Certificate parser
Project is at the very beginning of development. It is not ready for use.

The idea is that this project provides parsing of certificates's common fields and extensions. It is not intended to be a full-featured certificate parser/validator.
All business-specific or extension-specific logic should be implemented using plugin functionality.
